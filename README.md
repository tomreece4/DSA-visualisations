# Data Structures & Algorithms Visualiser (Python)

This project is a tool for visualising common **sorting**, **searching**, and **graph traversal** algorithms. Built with
`matplotlib`, it provides animated, real-time demonstrations of how each algorithm works. This is ideal for education, 
presentations, or learning data structures and algorithms interactively.
